# psf-msg-wallet

This is a command-line interface (CLI) forked from [psf-bch-wallet](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/psf-bch-wallet). This fork has all the same commands, but adds additional commands around sending an end-to-end encrypted (**E2EE**) message to any BCH address, similar to email. It uses a [Nostr](https://nostr.org/) relay to store the encrypted message, until the receiver can download and decrypt it with their BCH wallet.

Commands have also been added for uploading files to the [PSF IPFS network](https://psffpp.com). In the future, commands will be added for encrypting and decrypting files using a BCH wallet.

### Message Commands

This fork retains all the commands available in [psf-bch-wallet](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/psf-bch-wallet). Check that README for additional commands.

#### Check For New Messages

Check for new messages. If your address has recieved a message signal, the TXID of the message signal will be displayed. You'll need that TXID to download the message for decrypting and reading.

##### Arguments
- `-n` - flag to give your wallet name, to check for message signals sent to your address.

##### Example
- `node psf-msg-wallet.js msg-nostr-check -n wallet1`

#### Send E2EE Message

Send an end-to-end encrypted message to a BCH address. The 'subject' is not encrypted, but the message contents are. The receiver will need to have made at least one transaction with their address in order to send them a message. That way, their public key can be retrieved from the blockchain.

##### Example

- `node psf-msg-wallet.js msg-nostr-send -n wallet1 -s test -m "This is an encrypted message" -a bitcoincash:qqfrps47nxdvak55h3x97dqmglcaczegusma02uhqt`

##### Arguments
- `-n` - flag to specify the wallet paying for the message signal (required).
- `-s` - An un-encrypted subject line (optional).
- `-m` - A string of text to send as a message. This will be encrypted with the receivers public key. (required)
- `-a` - The BCH address of the receiver. (required)


#### Read E2EE Message

Download an E2EE message from a Nostr relay, and decrypt it using the private key from your wallet.

##### Example

- `node psf-msg-wallet.js msg-nostr-read -n wallet1 -t e7537fbeebb367e09793286f636ec6a4a0b04ba556ec90691b5e0107d18cc5cb`

##### Arguments

- `-n` - specify the wallet to check for messages (required).
- `-t` - The TXID of the message signal. This is provided by the `msg-check-nostr` command.

### File Commands

#### Stage a File for Pinning

Stage a file for pinning to the [PSF IPFS network](https://psffpp.com).

##### Arguments

- `-f` - specify the absolute file path for the file to be staged (required).

##### Example

- `node psf-msg-wallet.js file-stage -f test.txt`

#### Pin a Staged File

Pin a staged file to the [PSF IPFS network](https://psffpp.com).

##### Arguments

- `-n` - specify the wallet to pay for the pinning (required).
- `-c` - specify the CID of the file to be pinned (required).
- `-s` - specify the size of the file in megabytes (required) If the file is less than 1MB, use 1.
- `-f` - specify the name of the file to be pinned (required).

##### Example

- `node psf-msg-wallet.js file-pin -n wallet1 -c bafkreidsivvxjiz4c2jmhn2myckfcso6grk7yqk3iysjna4i2ed4w6mzeu -s 1 -f README.md`
